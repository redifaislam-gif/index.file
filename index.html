                            <p>Man, I have to say I have never had the customer service I have received from SpeakerMatch from any other company. I think they are outstanding! I have never seen a more professional and customer service based business. My first gig through SpeakerMatch paid for 10 years worth of the service. SM has paid for itself every year I have used it and I have received gigs that have landed me 5-figure speaking fees. I can't speak to other people's experiences but in my experience, I see that SpeakerMatch is a bargain, the staff is super willing to help, and the rest is up to the user. Thanks guys for all you have done for me!</p>

                            <p>signed up for SpeakerMatch in order to apply for a job I saw on the job board. I did apply, and I did get the job! Well worth the investment.

                            <p>Shortly after joining, I was shortlisted… which was exciting! In just one year, I’ve landed two speaking engagements through the SpeakerMatch application process. In addition, two local organizations found me in the SpeakerMatch online directory, and hired me to facilitate their retreats. I greatly appreciate the professional development SpeakerMatch offers through conference calls. I’ve learned so much since joining. And did I mention their customer service? The SpeakerMatch team genuinely cares about its clients, and that, to me, is very important. I look forward to continuing to be a SpeakerMatch member!</p>

                            <p>Thank you so much for putting this great service together, Bryan. I am not a no-fee, low-fee speaker, but have found that you do list organizations that pay higher amounts. The education group I booked was super pleased with what I did and have approached me to do another presentation. The lower fee organization that I did work with offered to do promotion for my new book coming out -- which is a service rendered and traded. I appreciate the easy, efficient way you have organized your service. I am a satisfied customer who has recouped the SpeakerMatch monthly fee many times over.</p>

So far the planners I have actually spoken with are very nice and happy that I contacted them. I love the updates, newsletters, etc. I feel apart of an organization that truly has my best interest at heart. This is a fantastic resource!!!

                            <p>When I joined SpeakerMatch, I was skeptical, thinking this was just another site luring professional speakers with visions of sudden bookings. I was dead wrong! The concept involves putting leads on the job board each week for speakers to respond to. Amazingly, I was able to book a presentation for an organization I would have never known about if I didn't see it listed on SpeakerMatch! The staff are always willing to help develop your profile and are professional and skilled at designing sites to attract meeting planners. I highly recommend SpeakerMatch, although by doing so, I'm slicing my own throat, because you will undoubtedly get more bookings that I want to selfishly save for myself.</p>

                            <p>If you think that SpeakerMatch is a scam, by all means don't use it. That will leave less competition for the posted openings for the rest of us. I've been a member for just over three months, at $49.95 a month, and I've already booked $6000 worth of speaking gigs; a traditional speakers bureau would have wanted 15-30% of that money. I am VERY pleased with SpeakerMatch. You rarely get something for nothing; I don't mind paying this monthly fee for the visibility and the genuine leads I've found.</p>

                            <p>SpeakerMatch really makes sense and I think highly of the service. It does a great job of connecting meeting planners with qualified speakers for what they need to impact their event. I attended a SpeakerMatch Boot Camp three years ago and got to know their management team and found them to be first rate and dedicated to helping meeting planners and speakers have an effective way to be brought together.</p>

                            <p>SpeakerMatch is the greatest tool for helping new and emerging speakers build their speaking business. Whether you are speaking part time or full time, SpeakerMatch will match you up with event planners who are interested in booking speakers. I have been a SpeakerMatch subscriber for the last 6 years and it provided me with the tools necessary to build my business, my referral base, and my career. I have never encountered a service that was so perfect for anyone wishing to grow their business.</p>

                            <p>I've been using SpeakerMatch for approx 4 years and would certainly recommend the service. The service gives me access to planners and events at my fingertips that I would have never been aware on my own. The service more than pays for itself. If you're a speaker, trainer or coach, don't hesitate to add this program to your marketing strategy.</p>

                            <p>The care and support I have received from Speaker Match has been a joyful experience. I love the personal contact and immediate response from Bryan, Paul and Justin. This is a business for speakers who are serious about speaking to audiences in the areas of their expertise. The website is easy to use; speakers can get in and out of the various categories with a minimum of effort. You don't have to be tech-savvy to join Speaker Match. So far, it has been a stress-free experience and I look forward to future speaking opportunities.</p>

                            <p>We've tried virtually every lead service out there. Some yielded nothing. Others worked for a while then the leads just stopped coming. On the other hand, I have SpeakerMatch on automatic renewal because there hasn't been a single year in all the 7+ years I've belonged when it hasn't provided solid value in terms of actual bookings. Plus, they've always been extremely professional, providing great customer service and working constantly to improve.</p>

There are many companies but only a few that say what they do and do what they say and SpeakerMatch is one of them. They are always enhancing the services they provide delivering more value to the speaker that ultimately results in more gigs---and that's the bottom line, isn't it?! I highly recommend them.</p>

I have used agents, marketed myself, and worked with bureaus; and every year, I find SpeakerMatch to be my number one source for new leads. I get access to meeting planners and events you can't find anywhere else. Every year, I book a few speeches with SpeakerMatch and every month, I add more and more meeting planners to my contact list. How much is that worth in this business? It's priceless!</p>

Not only did I not need the money back but I have since upgraded (and covered the membership costs with SpeakerMatch bookings!). I have applied to 4 listings and have booked 2 -- not a bad average! Suggestions are stellar; the staff WANTS you to succeed. Paul and Justin are kind, thoughtful, and candid. I am a HUGE fan of SpeakerMatch and a very happy subscriber.</p>

            <p class="">This service was EXCEPTIONAL!!!! When I started out on this task, I had no idea how I would be able to come up with 3 nationally recognized speakers in such a short period of time for an event quickly approaching. This streamlined the whole process and shortened the completion time considerably. I will definitely use this service again.The quality of your candidate pool is AWESOME!!!!</p>

            <p class=""> did receive quite a lot of responses w/most of them being right on the nose. I'm still sifting thru and talking it out w/the committee. This site is fantastic!! I'm so glad I found it. It's the only site I found that lets you build your own profile, and the responses you receive REALLY fit your needs. LOVE IT!</p>

            <p class="">May I tell you how pleased we are with SpeakerMatch. We discovered your service quite by accident, and we are very happy that we did. As a large supplier of lecturers, instructors and speakers to major cruise lines and resorts, we found ourselves in a situation were we required a qualified speaker in very short time. The SpeakerMatch service served us beautifully. Within 24 hours, we found ten top-notch speakers with the expertise we were looking for... needless to say we were able to solve our concern.</p>

            <p class="">SpeakerMatch was an excellent tool. It provided many outlets to speakers I otherwise wouldn't have known about. We were looking for someone simply for our small company Christmas party and were able to find someone QUICKLY AND EFFORTLESSLY. Once our information was posted, I just sat back and let the speaker responses come to me. I think whether you are looking for a speaker for a big event or small event you will DEFINITELY find a speaker by using SpeakerMatch!</p>
